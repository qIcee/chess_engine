HI
In this project I will try to first implement a chess engine, then implement one, or as chance might allow it, two machine learning models and train those using the chess engine and train them.
I've thought of doing one model that solely learns on its own and another that uses already available data for training. Maybe combine the both?
Either way, this should be a fun project and we'll see how far I come.
